Looking at the failed diff, I can see it's trying to add a delete button after the download button. However, since the original file content is empty, I cannot generate the complete file content that would result from applying this diff. The diff appears to be a fragment that should be applied to an existing React component file, but without the original content, I cannot provide the complete corrected file.
